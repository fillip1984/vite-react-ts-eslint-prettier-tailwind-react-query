# VITE + React + Typescript + Eslint + Prettier + Tailwind + React-Query

A starter for React with Typescript and many more useful libraries that I commonly use. I plan to use this repository to build out future side projects. You pull down a fresh copy using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit)

This repository was inspired by a repository I found on github [TheSwordBreaker/vite-reactts-eslint-prettier](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheSwordBreaker/vite-reactts-eslint-prettier/main/README.md)

## Prerequisites

1) running 'npx degit' will install degit globally. You can do this separately or it will install when running commands below
2) [git](https://git-scm.com/) must be installed
## Installation

After following these steps once you have alternate options. For now, follow these steps:
0) Install degit (only required if you haven't used degit) - 'npm install -g degit'

1) Clone the repo, replace &lt;project name&gt; with the name of the application - 'npx degit fillip1984/vite-react-ts-eslint-prettier-tailwind-react-query &lt;project name&gt;'
2) Open the directory - cd &lt;project name&gt;
3) Install packages - 'npm install'

4) Either:
    * Start application from terminal - 'npm run dev'
    * Open VS Code - 'code .'

Now that you've used degit once:
1) Start the process with 'degit'
2) Select the template that you've previously used
3) Enter the destination
4) Decide if you want to use the cached version or not
