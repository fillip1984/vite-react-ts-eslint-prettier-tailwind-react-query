# VITE + React + Typescript + Eslint + Prettier + Tailwind + React-Query

A starter for React with Typescript and many more useful libraries that I commonly use. I plan to use this repository to build out future side projects. You pull down a fresh copy using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit)

This repository was inspired by a repository I found on github [TheSwordBreaker/vite-reactts-eslint-prettier](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheSwordBreaker/vite-reactts-eslint-prettier/main/README.md)

## Installation

1) Clone the repo
2) run 'npm install'
3) run 'npm run dev'
